# Personal Portfolio Website

## Overview
This repository contains my first full portfolio site built from the HTML, CSS, and JavaScript skills I have been learning. The goal was to translate those lessons into a real project that introduces who I am, highlights my work, and makes it easy for people to get in touch.

## Tech Stack
- HTML for the overall structure of each page
- CSS for layout, color, and responsive styling
- JavaScript for interactive touches, including a live Minneapolis clock

## Key Pages
- `index.html`: Landing page with quick links to every section
- `about.html`: Personal introduction and background
- `project.html`: Current projects such as the Online Store Clone
- `resume.html`: Downloadable résumé and experience summary
- `contact.html`: Contact details and quick message options

## Highlights
- Designed and coded every page from scratch to practice the fundamentals of web development
- Implemented consistent navigation to move between About, Projects, Resume, and Contact pages
- Experimented with JavaScript to add small interactive elements and prepare for richer features

## Next Steps
- Add more advanced JavaScript interactions to deepen front-end skills
- Polish responsive behaviors for a wider range of devices
- Keep updating the Projects page as I complete new work
